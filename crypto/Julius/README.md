## Description
Author: Josch

I found this ancient text from Roman times but it's encrypted by their most cutting-edge encryption method, maybe you can decrypt it and prove that you're smarter than the Roman emperors?

### Hint
CyberChef is a great tool for working with text encodings and encryptions

## Solution
Well the hint is right about that. The title alludes to Julius Caesar and the Caesar cipher. In cyberchef this goes under the [recipe ROT13](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=ROT13(true,true,false,13)&input=VUZQR1N7MHlxX2ZwdTAweV9wZWxjZ2J0ZW5jdWx9)
