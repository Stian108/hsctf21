Author: Josch

A scientist studying string theory has forgotten the password to his super secret research, can you help him recover it?

### Hint
Are you able to recognize the encryption function?

## Solution
Well, this one is mostly like it says on the tin:

```
strings stringtheory | grep HSCTF
```

```
HSCTF{sometimes_strings_is_all_you_need!}
```
